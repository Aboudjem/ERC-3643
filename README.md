</p>
Welcome to **ERC-3643 Raptor Version** ü¶ñ! This project is a fork of the [**T-Rex (ERC-3643) standard**](https://github.com/TokenySolutions/T-REX/), which was originally developed by @TokenySolutions. As one of the authors of the ERC-3643, I have worked on this fork independently with the goal of creating a simplified, optimized, and more accessible version. The Raptor aims to make working with security tokens easier to understand and more user-friendly, without attempting to compete with the original T-Rex implementation.

## Why Raptor?

![Why?](https://media0.giphy.com/media/3o7btPCcdNniyf0ArS/giphy.gif)

A Raptor is a smaller, lighter dinosaur ‚Äî just like this project. Raptor is a leaner, more efficient take on the T-Rex standard. By streamlining the original, we've made it more accessible and easier to grasp for everyone.

## Changes & Updates

Compared to the original T-Rex standard, Raptor has undergone several major changes:

### üéõÔ∏è Optimized

- `isVerified` function is now more streamlined and efficient.
- Type casting instances have been minimized by directly changing the types of function parameters.
- Unnecessary checks and logic have been removed to save gas.
- `_msgSender()` function from OpenZeppelin's `Context` contract is used for consistent message sender's address retrieval in meta-transactions.

### ‚ùå Removed

- Proxies have been removed from the project, simplifying the structure and reducing gas cost.
- Removed `UpdatedTokenInformation` event
- Removed `setName`, `setSymbol`, and `setDecimals` functions for closer adherence to the ERC20 standard.
- Redundant checks for empty strings in the `_name` and `_symbol` parameters have been removed.

### ‚ûï Added

- `UpdatedOnchainID` event has been introduced.
- Several internal and private functions have been added to optimize gas cost and enhance code clarity.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Updated

- Role management now utilizes OpenZeppelin's `AccessControl` instead of `AgentRole`.
- Custom `Pausable` mechanism has been replaced with OpenZeppelin's `Pausable` for better flexibility and compatibility.
- Event parameters have been updated with respective interface types.
- A check for array mismatches has been added for improved robustness.
- The `batchTransferFrom` function is added for efficient multiple transfers.

### üìù Documentation

- Inline documentation has been substantially improved and expanded.

### üß™ Tests

- Tests have been updated to reflect the changes in contract logic.
